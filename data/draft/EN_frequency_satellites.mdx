After exploring the various orbits on which satellites are placed, we’re now diving into the different frequency bands they use. Let’s first review how the **radio spectrum** is laid out (open it full screen for a better view).

I’ve added a few usage examples to help you get your bearings.
To meet more specific engineering needs, sub-bands have been introduced that are widely used for **satellite communications**. It’s these sub-bands that we’re gonna focus on in this lesson.

# Specialized Bands
Here’s how these well-known bands are organized, ranging from UHF to EHF.

![Satellite Bands](/images/blog/2025/frequency_satellites/frequency_satellites2.svg)
## L Band 
The **L band** ranges from `1GHZ` to `2GHz` in the UHF spectrum. It’s widely used for satellite positioning systems like <SmartLink slug="gps">GNSS</SmartLink>, such as the famous American **GPS** or the European **Galileo**. You’ll also find weather satellites like <SmartLink slug="noaa">NOAA</SmartLink>, <SmartLink slug="meteor">METEOR</SmartLink>, [GOES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_Operational_Environmental_Satellite) and many more! Yep, **NOAA** and **METEOR** also broadcast in [VHF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tr%C3%A8s_haute_fr%C3%A9quence) at `137MHz`, among other data types.
These waves have the advantage of being highly resistant to weather conditions like rain, but they aren’t built to carry huge amounts of data due to their low bandwidth.

## S Band 
The **S band** stretches from `2GHZ` to `4GHz`, straddling both UHF and SHF. You’ll again find weather satellites like <SmartLink slug="noaa">NOAA</SmartLink> and also the [DMSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_Meteorological_Satellite_Program) (Defense Meteorological Satellite Program). There are solar observation satellites like [Hinode (Solar-B)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinode_(satellite)). Plus, it handles audio communications with the [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Station_spatiale_internationale) (ISS).
In short, while this band is also resilient against bad weather, it’s best suited for communications that don’t demand high bandwidth.

## C Band 
The **C band** covers `4GHZ` to `8GHz` in the SHF range. It’s hugely popular for satellite TV, especially in rainy climates. Think of the first telecom satellite [Early Bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelsat_I) by **Intelsat** or some of the older [Hot Bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Bird#:~:text=Hot%20Bird%20est%20le%20principal,de%20120%20millions%20de%20foyers.) satellites from **Eutelsat** that use it.
These satellites are often placed in <SmartLink slug="orbits">geostationary orbit</SmartLink> to cover vast areas. Although the C band offers decent bandwidth, it requires pretty big satellite dishes (`2`/`3m`) for TV reception. Plus, it’s getting more congested worldwide, pushing companies to move to higher frequency bands. Also, this band is affected by 5G network interference around `3.5GHz`.

## X Band 
The **X band** spans from `8GHZ` to `12GHz`, also within the SHF range. Widely used by militaries around the globe, like French Syracuse satellites or American [WGS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wideband_Global_SATCOM), its high bandwidth allows for high-resolution image transmission along with encrypted communications. However, weather conditions start to impact it, forcing satellites into lower orbits which reduces their coverage.

## Ku Band 
The **Ku band** (**K**urz-**u**nder, with K for *Kurz* meaning short in German, and u for under) runs from `12GHZ` to `18GHz` in the SHF band. Super popular, it’s the go-to for satellite TV, gradually replacing the C band. In fact, this band can transmit more data with much smaller satellite dishes (`60cm`/`1m`). Although rain affects it, advances like robust modulation techniques and automatic correction systems help minimize signal loss. You’ll find satellites such as [Hot Bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Bird) and [EuroBird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eutelsat_31A) from **Eutelsat** or even [Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_(satellite)) from **Intelsat**. It also handles audio, video, and data communications with the **ISS**, unlike the S Band which is used only for audio. **Starlink** also makes use of part of this band for uplink and downlink between the satellite and the user’s antenna (terminal).

## K Band
The **K band** ranges from `18GHZ` to `27GHz`, the last of the SHF frequencies. At `22.235GHz`, water vapor molecules in the atmosphere hit their natural resonance, meaning they absorb electromagnetic waves effectively at that frequency, causing signal attenuation. We won’t get into the chemical details, but this band isn’t designed for long-range communications because of that critical frequency. In short, it’s rarely used except for a few radars and radio telescopes. Also note the segments `17.80-18.60GHz` and `18.80-19.30GHz` that **Starlink** uses for communications between satellites and ground stations connecting the satellite network to the Internet (gateways).

## Ka Band 
Finally, we hit the EHF range with the **Ka band** (**K**urz-**a**bove, meaning “above”), which runs from `27GHz` to `40GHz` (yeah, there’s still `3GHz` left in SHF). Due to the very high frequencies, there’s significant weather-related attenuation, making it less ideal for rainy climates without advanced modulation techniques. However, it offers massive bandwidth, supporting bidirectional communications that can handle huge amounts of data with small satellite dishes. Plus, the Ka band packs more frequencies than the Ku band, meaning more capacity translates to more offers and lower prices. That’s why this band is a favorite for satellites providing Internet services akin to ADSL. You’ll see many of the usual players like **Intelsat**, **Eutelsat**, or **Starlink** using it for communications between satellites and gateways.

## V Band
The **V band** spans from `40GHZ` to `75GHz` within the EHF range. It’s an experimental band that, despite breaking bandwidth records, is heavily impacted by atmospheric conditions. **Starlink** has started using it, but there are significant challenges to overcome before it’s fully viable. There’s also a WiFi standard known as [WiGig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11ad) that uses `60GHz`, with a range of just `10m` but a theoretical throughput of up to `6.75GHz`! In short, there isn’t much to say about this band other than it might become really popular in the coming years.

And that’s it for this lesson loaded with info, the more you know about these bands, the better for dabbling in satellite radio hobbies.
Just a quick note: despite their high frequencies, these waves aren’t dangerous to your health! They’re always in the realm of non-ionizing radiation and can’t alter your [DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADN) 🧬.
