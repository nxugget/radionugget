The [DragonOS](https://cemaxecuter.com/) distribution is a fork of [Lubuntu](https://lubuntu.fr/), but it’s specialized for <SmartLink slug="sdr">SDR</SmartLink>. It comes preloaded with a ton of useful tools like [GNURadio](https://www.gnuradio.org/). It’s super cool because it saves you time, many radio tools are outdated and can be a pain to set up.

# Installation
To grab the **ISO**, just head over [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/dragonos-focal/files/latest/download). Next, you’ll need a hypervisor like **VirtualBox** or **VMWare**, whichever you prefer. Since I’m on **Windows**, I’m keeping it simple with **VirtualBox**, which you can download [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads). For **Mac ARM**, you’d need to use **VMWare** :)  
Launch **VirtualBox** and click the **New** button to import your **ISO**.

Click **Next** to allocate your hardware resources. For **RAM**, 4GB should suffice; if in doubt (since some apps can be hungry), I recommend 8GB (8192Mb). For the **CPU**, it depends on your setup, I set it to **6**, though **2** or **4** should work fine.

Then, click **Next** to set up disk space. Allocate at least **30GB** since later steps require a minimum of 30GB.

Finally, click **Next** and then **Finish**.

# First Boot
Now, double-click to launch **DragonOS**. You might see a screen like this:

Press **Enter** and after a few moments, you’ll land on a desktop that looks like this:

The installation isn’t complete yet, you’ll notice an **Install DragonOS FocalX** icon on the desktop. You need to run it because if you shut down the VM now, everything you did will be lost.  
Double-click the icon and follow the installation prompts. The default options work fine. After a bit, you’ll be prompted to reboot the VM, and then you’re all set!

# Exploration
On **DragonOS**, you’ll find a slew of preinstalled software, so we won’t cover them all. I’ll let you explore based on your own needs, but know there’s something for every radio enthusiast.
Let’s test things out by plugging in your **SDR** receiver. In my setup, I use the **RTL-SDR V4** dongle along with the awesome **SDR++** software.
Before proceeding, you need to instruct **VirtualBox** to recognize your **SDR** dongle connected via your host’s **USB** port. In the menu, go to **Devices -> USB** and click on your **SDR** receiver.

Now, you’re ready to listen. In **SDR++**, under **Source**, select **RTL-SDR** and choose your receiver from the dropdown below. Then click the **Play** button and everything should work like a charm!

# Shared Folder
When you want to work with files from your **host machine** on your **VM**, you’ll need a way to transfer them. A simple solution is setting up a **shared folder**.
First, ensure that the **Guest Additions** are installed. These drivers enhance the interaction between the **VM** and the **host**.
Within the **VM**, click on **Devices -> Insert Guest Additions CD Image...** at the top, and then **Execute** the `autorun.sh` script.

Next, shut down the **VM**, click on **Settings** (the yellow gear icon), then go to **Shared Folders**. Right-click and choose **Add Shared Folder**.
Finally, select the folder from your host machine you’d like to share and check **Auto-Mount**.

Now, inside the **VM** file explorer, you should see your shared folder under the name `sf_Downloads`.
If you encounter any permissions issues, open a **terminal** and type `sudo adduser [your-user] vboxsf`, then reboot the **VM**, and it should work perfectly.

And that’s it, **DragonOS** is ready to be used!
