Challenge description: *Your spacecraft has provided its Cartesian ICRF position (km) and velocity (km/s). What is its orbit (expressed as Keplerian elements)?*

The challenge is available at [this address](https://github.com/cromulencellc/hackasat-qualifier-2021/tree/main/kepler).

Let's connect to the challenge instance:
```bash
> docker run --rm -i -e FLAG=pouet kepler:challenge
         KEPLER
        CHALLANGE
       a e i Ω ω υ
            .  .
        ,'   ,=,  .
      ,    /     \  .
     .    |       | .
    .      \     / .
    +        '='  .
     .          .'
      .     . '
         '
Your spacecraft reports that its Cartesian ICRF position (km) and velocity (km/s) are:
Pos (km):   [8449.401305, 9125.794363, -17.461357]
Vel (km/s): [-1.419072, 6.780149, 0.002865]
Time:       2021-06-26-19:20:00.000-UTC

What is its orbit (expressed as Keplerian elements a, e, i, Ω, ω, and υ)?
Semimajor axis, a (km):
```

We need to determine the orbital parameters from the given Cartesian position and velocity. It’s important to understand what these orbital elements represent. For a refresher on orbital data, check out this lesson on [TLE basics](<SmartLink slug="tle">just here</SmartLink>) :)

Below is a diagram illustrating the various parameters (note: the spacecraft’s placement is arbitrary for illustration):

The calculations to extract the orbital elements can be pretty involved. So instead, we’ll use the Python library [poliastro](https://github.com/poliastro/poliastro) to do the heavy lifting.

First, convert our lists for position and velocity into quantities with proper physical units:
```py
from poliastro.twobody.orbit import u

pos = [8449.401305, 9125.794363, -17.461357]
vel = [-1.419072, 6.780149, 0.002865]

pos_km = [*pos] * u.km
vel_kms = [*vel] * u.km / u.s
```
Here, multiplying by `u.km` and `u.km/u.s` (from [astropy](https://github.com/astropy/astropy)) converts each coordinate into a `Quantity` with the appropriate units.

Next, we call the method `Orbit.from_vectors` to calculate the orbital elements:
```py
from poliastro.bodies import Earth
from poliastro.twobody import Orbit

time = "2021-06-26 19:20:00.000"
orb = Orbit.from_vectors(Earth, pos_km, vel_kms, time)
```
Here, `Earth` provides the necessary gravitational parameters. And specifying the exact time is crucial since orbital parameters can change over time.

Once the orbit has been computed, we can extract the six Keplerian elements:
```py
a = orb.a              # Semimajor axis in km
e = orb.ecc            # Eccentricity
i = orb.inc.to_value(u.deg)    # Inclination (converted to degrees)
Omega = orb.raan.to_value(u.deg)   # Right ascension of the ascending node (deg)
omega = orb.argp.to_value(u.deg)   # Argument of perigee (deg)
nu = orb.nu.to_value(u.deg)    # True anomaly (deg)
```
Using `to_value(u.deg)` (from astropy) converts the angles from radians to degrees.

Finally, print all the orbital parameters and verify:
```bash
> docker run --rm -i -e FLAG=pouet kepler:challenge
         KEPLER
        CHALLANGE
       a e i Ω ω υ
            .  .
        ,'   ,=,  .
      ,    /     \  .
     .    |       | .
    .      \     / .
    +        '='  .
     .          .'
      .     . '
         '
Your spacecraft reports that its Cartesian ICRF position (km) and velocity (km/s) are:
Pos (km):   [8449.401305, 9125.794363, -17.461357]

What is its orbit (expressed as Keplerian elements a, e, i, Ω, ω, and υ)?
Semimajor axis, a (km): 24732.885760723184  
Eccentricity, e: 0.7068070220620631  
Inclination, i (deg): 0.11790360842507447  
Right ascension of the ascending node, Ω (deg): 90.22650379956278  
Argument of perigee, ω (deg): 226.58745900876278
