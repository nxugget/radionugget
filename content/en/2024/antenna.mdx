An antenna is nothing more than a piece of metal. Its job is to convert **electrical energy** into an **electromagnetic wave** for transmitting a **radio signal**, and vice versa for receiving. In this lesson, we’ll cover the key concepts you need to choose the right antenna, whether it’s for an <SmartLink slug="sdr">SDR</SmartLink> project or anything else.

# Frequency
To choose an antenna, you first need to decide on the **frequency** you’re working with. But what exactly is **frequency**?  
When you plug into a wall outlet, the current is **alternating**, meaning it regularly switches direction (it goes from + to – and back). This change happens smoothly, forming a neat **sine wave**.  
![Schema courant alternatif sinusoïdal](/images/blog/2024/antennes/antenne1.svg)
For example, in **France**, the current oscillates at **50Hz**, meaning it changes direction **100 times per second**. That’s what we call **frequency**, measured in [Hertz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz).  
A radio is also an oscillator; we refer to a [VFO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscillateur_%C3%A0_fr%C3%A9quence_variable) (Variable Frequency Oscillator) – a fancy way of saying you can change the frequency.  
For instance, in your car you might turn the dial to tune into **102.4MHz** (NRJ), which means there are **102.4 million** **oscillations** per second!

# Wavelength
The most important aspect of an antenna is its length, which should be chosen according to the **frequency** you’re interested in. We say an antenna is **resonant** at a specific frequency, which means it converts **electrical energy** to **radio waves** (and vice versa) efficiently.  
For an antenna to be in **resonance** with a frequency, its length must correspond to a specific fraction of the **signal’s wavelength**.
![Schema longueur d'onde](/images/blog/2024/antennes/antenne2.svg)
The wavelength is calculated with a simplified formula, knowing that we work mostly with frequencies in `MHz` and the **speed of light**:
![Formule longueur d'onde](/images/blog/2024/antennes/antenne3.svg)
Once you’ve calculated the **wavelength** of the signal you want to use, you can choose a **fraction** of that value to size your antenna, typically a **half-wave** (`λ/2`) or a **quarter-wave** (`λ/4`).  
For example, suppose you want an antenna for the `433MHz` band. First, calculate the wavelength: `300/433≈0.70cm`. If you decide on a **half-wave** antenna, its length should be half the wavelength, so about `34.5cm`.

# Impedance
Let’s keep it simple. For effective signal transfer between the antenna and your transceiver, they must be well matched. This matching is determined by a property called **impedance**.  
Think of it as the **resistance** in an electrical circuit, but for alternating currents. In **RF**, you want the antenna’s **impedance** to match that of your device. A common standard is `50Ω`, for example, SDR receivers typically use this value. In short, you’ll always aim for an antenna close to `50Ω`.

# Types of Antennas
There are tons of antenna types, so we won’t cover them all, but here are three important ones.

## Dipole (Doublet)
The simplest antenna is a **doublet**. It comes in a folded version (often called a [trombone](https://rogerbeep.fr/les-cours-2/antennes-ouvertes-fermees/#:~:text=Une%20antenne%20est%20ferm%C3%A9e%20lorsque,est%20proche%20de%20200%20%CE%A9%20.)) and the classic **dipole**; we’ll focus on the latter, though both work on the same principle.  
In its basic form, it’s a **half-wave** antenna (`λ/2`), with each arm measuring `λ/4`. It is fed at its center and is installed isolated in space, away from the ground.
![Schema dipole](/images/blog/2024/antennes/antenne4.svg)
The angle between the **2 arms** can be adjusted to fine-tune the **impedance**. When they’re straight as shown, the impedance is `75Ω`. With a `120°` angle, you achieve a `50Ω` match as seen in <SmartLink href="/blog/space/satellite/noaa">this project</SmartLink>.  
Also, a **dipole** can be mounted **horizontally** or **vertically**, depending on the [polarization](https://culturesciencesphysique.ens-lyon.fr/ressource/simu-polarisation.xml) of the waves you want to capture.  
Lastly, this type of antenna focuses its energy in two directions, making it very effective when you know the precise direction of your signal.

## Ground Plane
A **ground plane** antenna features a vertical conductor of **quarter-wave** length (`λ/4`) mounted above a conductive surface, known as the **ground plane**, hence the name. This ground plane acts like a **mirror**, “completing” the antenna by reflecting waves, effectively creating an equivalent to a **dipole**.  
To form this ground plane, you can use metallic rods called **radiators** arranged evenly around the base, giving the antenna a spider-like look 🕷️. Similar to the **dipole**, if you want a `50Ω` system, the radials should be spaced at about `120°`.  
Otherwise, you can use the ground, the sea, a car roof, anything conductive.

## Yagi
Yagi antennas, which work from [HF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haute_fr%C3%A9quence) to [UHF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_haute_fr%C3%A9quence), are **directional**. Also known as “rake” antennas, they’re the ones usually seen on rooftops for terrestrial TV.  
The idea is to start with a half-wave **doublet** (`λ/2`), then add non-powered parasitic elements to **focus** the energy in a specific direction. You have **director** elements, which are shorter than the doublet and placed in front, and **reflector** elements, which are longer and positioned behind.  
![Schema Yagi](/images/blog/2024/antennes/antennes7.svg)
By increasing the number of elements, the **impedance** decreases and the **gain** increases ↗️. These antennas are great when you need to capture a signal coming from a particular direction, as they concentrate the energy toward it.

# Conclusion
You should now have a better understanding of how to choose your antenna and adjust its size according to the signal you want to receive :)
