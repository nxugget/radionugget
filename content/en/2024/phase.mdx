Not all signals behave the same over time. In this lesson, we’re diving into the concept of **phase** and how **phase shift** can modify the alignment of waves.

# Phase
The **phase** of a signal is a measure that represents the shape of a **sine wave** at a specific moment. It’s usually expressed in **degrees** (from **0°** to **360°**) or in **radians** (from **0** to **2π**).  
But what does the number **π** have to do with our radio waves? Let’s take a trip back to **trigonometry** with this diagram:

No matter what the frequency of a signal is, its **period** (or cycle) always corresponds to a full rotation, either **360°** or **2π**.

Two signals are said to be in **phase** when their peaks and troughs line up, in other words, they oscillate together. This is called **zero phase shift**.

# Phase Shift
A **phase shift** is simply a difference in the timing or position of a wave. In basic terms, if two waves start at different times or reach their peaks at different moments, they are phase-shifted.  
For example, if the **phase shift** is **180°** (or **π radians**), one signal is exactly out of step with the other, this is known as **phase opposition**. In that case, the maximum amplitude of one signal aligns with the minimum of the other.

Alternatively, if the phase shift is **90°** (or **π/2 radians**), one signal leads the other by a quarter cycle. This is called **quadrature**, meaning that the peak of one signal coincides with the zero crossing of the other.

And that’s a wrap on this quick lesson on **phase**. Understanding these basics will help when we dive into wave **polarity** later.
