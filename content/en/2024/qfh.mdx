In my very first project to <SmartLink href="/blog/space/satellite/noaa">receive satellite images</SmartLink>, I built a **V-dipole** antenna. It’s very easy to make and produces convincing results.  
The downside? All those gray interference bands on every image, like [this one](https://station.radionugget.com/images/NOAA-19-20240816-201800-MCIR.jpg).  
I tried countless fixes to remove them but to no avail, so I decided to switch to a **quadrifilar** antenna, or **QFH** (**Q**uadri**F**ilar **H**elicoidal). Let’s see if this solves the problem :)

# How a QFH Antenna Works
The **QFH** antenna consists of two helical loops, each wrapped around a central axis and offset by **90°**. For more on phase shift, check out <SmartLink slug="phase">this lesson</SmartLink>.  
Thanks to this phase offset, the helices produce **circular polarization**. Think of it as the "direction" of the electric field in our wave.

![Circular Polarization](/images/blog/2024/qfh/qfh17.gif)
Unlike the **V-dipole** we previously built that has **horizontal polarization**, which causes losses because satellite signals are circularly polarized, the QFH is designed to match the incoming circular polarization.

# Building the Antenna
Keep in mind that your antenna will ultimately look like this (in 2D diagrams it might not seem that way):

## Theory
To design the antenna, we’ll use [this calculator](http://jcoppens.com/ant/qfh/calc.en.php).  
- **Design Frequency**: I set it to `137.5MHz` since I want to receive satellite signals between `137` and `138MHz`.  
- **Conductor Diameter**: I use `9.5mm` because I'll use a 3/8" copper tube (which is about `9.52mm`). Any diameter works—larger ones may broaden the antenna’s bandwidth and slightly reduce losses—but the gains are modest, so use what you have.

After filling in the defaults, click **Calculate**.  
You’ll get an approximate schematic. Note the `-0.5cm` on the **top 4 wires only**; this ensures there’s enough space between them to join together.

## DIY Build
Let’s start by listing the supplies (excluding tools). For the copper, I used spare copper crowns from air conditioning work. It’s **annealed copper**, so it’s very malleable.

![DIY QFH Parts List](/images/blog/2024/qfh/qfh2.svg)

### Top Section
To simplify the build, I used a PVC sleeve that we will place on top of the antenna.  
You’ll need to drill 4 holes perfectly perpendicular around the sleeve. For that, head back to [this site](http://jcoppens.com/ant/qfh/calc.en.php) and scroll down to **Generate a drilling template**.  
Fill in the outer diameter of the sleeve (`58mm`) and the copper tube diameter (`9.5mm`).

![Generate a Drilling Template](/images/blog/2024/qfh/qfh3.webp)
Once generated, print the template and keep only the **Top** portion.  
Wrap it around the PVC tube. It’s crucial that the paper exactly covers the tube’s circumference—an error of even `1mm` can affect the alignment of the **4 copper rods**. If it doesn’t fit perfectly, double-check your measurements.

### Bottom Section
Return to the **Generate a drilling template** section of the calculator. This time, use the outer diameter of the PVC tube (`52mm`)—be sure not to confuse it with the sleeve’s diameter used for the top. 

![Generate a Drilling Template](/images/blog/2024/qfh/qfh10.webp)
Then, cut out the **Bottom** part of the template to wrap around the tube.  
To know where to place it, note the value `695.10mm` on the template; this represents the distance from the top wires to point **A** (essentially, the H2 distance on the antenna diagram).

### Bending the Tubes
You can loosely position the elbows (without fixing them) at the end of each of the 4 long copper rods, either on the top or bottom of the antenna—the goal is to form a smooth curve. You might need to tighten the elbows slightly to prevent slippage while bending.  
For bending, several techniques exist; in my case, I did it manually following this principle:

![QFH Bending Diagram](/images/blog/2024/qfh/qfh13.svg)
⚠️ IMPORTANT: The satellite signals we want to receive are **Right-Hand Circularly Polarized (RHCP)**. This means you must bend the tubes in a **counterclockwise** direction when viewed from above.
Once satisfied with the bending, fix the elbows permanently. I was fortunate to have access to a strong abrader, which was simpler and faster than soldering with tin.

![DIY QFH Fixing Elbows](/images/blog/2024/qfh/qfh12.webp)
Using water on the copper helps cool it to prevent the PVC from melting due to heat.  
Alternatively, you can clamp the elbows tightly with the tube. The contact may not be perfect, but it works in a pinch.

### Balun
Now, we’ll drill 2 holes at the top of the tube to create a **balun**.  
The signal converts into current in one branch in one direction and in the other branch in the opposite direction, meaning the current is **balanced** in the antenna.  
However, in a coaxial cable, the current travels **only in the center**—making it **unbalanced**. The outer braid is tied to ground and serves as a shield to prevent the cable from acting as an antenna (and to protect the signal).  
If left uncorrected, some of the received signal will go to ground, causing significant losses.  
A **balun** converts from **balanced** to **unbalanced** (or vice versa), resolving this issue.

![QFH Balun](/images/blog/2024/qfh/qfh15.jpg)
This is a **1:1 balun**. The first “1” represents the impedance on the balanced side (the antenna, approximately `50Ω`), and the second “1” is for the unbalanced side (the cable, also `50Ω`). In a 1:1 balun, these two impedances are equal.  
The choice of **4 turns** is not absolute but appears optimal for [VHF waves](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Très_haute_fréquence).

### Wiring
There are several ways to connect the rods. Here’s a schematic of the proper wiring:

![QFH Wiring Diagram](/images/blog/2024/qfh/qfh5.svg)
First, drill small holes at the end of each copper rod and file them smooth.

![DIY QFH Wiring](/images/blog/2024/qfh/qfh6.webp)
Then, wire the connections as shown in the diagram. I did it without soldering by twisting the wires together and securing them with zip ties.

![DIY QFH Wired](/images/blog/2024/qfh/qfh7.jpg)
Soldering is ideal, but for signals like NOAA and METEOR, this method works.

Here, the red illustrates the current from the cable's center and the blue from the braid.
Finally, cover the top to protect the wiring from the rain.

### Installation
I drilled a small hole at the bottom of the tube to let the cable exit; this prevents it from being crushed when laying the antenna flat.

![DIY QFH Cable Exit](/images/blog/2024/qfh/qfh11.jpg)
To raise the antenna as high as possible, I added an extra piece of PVC tube. Lacking a sleeve to connect them, I used a **T-joint**.
And there you have it—the antenna proudly installed on my roof.

# Testing
Now, let’s check its performance using an antenna tester. Although these values are mostly useful for transmission, they help verify if our antenna is well tuned.

![QFH SWR Test](/images/blog/2024/qfh/qfh16.jpg)
The **VSWR** is `1.487`, which is excellent for a DIY QFH antenna—anything `<1.5` means it’s well calibrated.  
The **impedance** of `46.21Ω` is also very good, as it’s close to the desired `50Ω`.

Finally, here’s the output the antenna provides:

Concerning the original interference issue, my images now show (almost) no interference! Check out some examples in my [gallery](https://radionugget.com/gallery).
