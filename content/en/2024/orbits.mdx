When launching a satellite into space, you have an infinite number of orbits to choose from.  
For the vast majority of satellites, what matters is **Earth**, since that is what they interact with. To be effective, they must be placed in an **orbit** that considers both their movement around **Earth** and the Earth’s rotation on its axis.  
Only a few specific orbits optimize these factors, and we’re going to explain why in this lesson.

# Geostationary Orbit (GEO)
This is an orbit that perfectly matches Earth’s rotation. As a result, satellites placed in this orbit appear “stationary” above a fixed point. Since they move in sync with **Earth**, they complete one orbit in **24 hours** (**23h 56min 4s** exactly).  
We’ll use [satvis](https://satvis.space/next/?tags=&sats=GOES%7E17) to illustrate this, taking for example the weather satellite [GOES-17](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GOES-17).  
![2D Map satellite cover](/images/blog/2024/type-orbits/type-orbits1.svg)
In this image, you can see that this satellite has a huge field of view covering the two American continents ,  nearly an entire **hemisphere** 🌎.  
In 2D view, the satellite coverage looks like:

And you can even obtain images useful for weather forecasting, for example:

Though this orbit is ideal for many activities, its major drawback is its distance from **Earth** ,  about **35786km** (at the **equator**)! This not only makes it very expensive to launch a satellite so far, but also introduces a **22-second** delay for signals to travel between the satellite and Earth, complicating certain operations ⏳.

# Medium Earth Orbit (MEO)
Let’s move closer with Medium Earth Orbit, which lies between Low Earth Orbit and Geostationary Orbit.  
This orbit is ideal for **navigation satellites** operating in a **constellation**. In this orbit, each satellite can view about **38%** of Earth’s surface while orbiting quickly enough to cover the globe. Their orbital periods vary between **2** and **12 hours**.  
For instance, check out [satvis](https://satvis.space/next/?tags=&scene=2D&elements=Point,Label,Orbit-track&sats=GSAT0201%7E%28GALILEO%7E5%29,GSAT0202%7E%28GALILEO%7E6%29,GSAT0203%7E%28GALILEO%7E7%29,GSAT0204%7E%28GALILEO%7E8%29,GSAT0205%7E%28GALILEO%7E9%29,GSAT0103%7E%28GALILEO-FM3%29,GSAT0215%7E%28GALILEO%7E19%29,GSAT0216%7E%28GALILEO%7E20%29,GSAT0214%7E%28GALILEO%7E18%29,GSAT0213%7E%28GALILEO%7E17%29,GSAT0212%7E%28GALILEO%7E16%29,GSAT0217%7E%28GALILEO%7E21%29,GSAT0218%7E%28GALILEO%7E22%29,GSAT0223%7E%28GALILEO%7E27%29,GSAT0222%7E%28GALILEO%7E26%29,GSAT0221%7E%28GALILEO%7E25%29,GSAT0220%7E%28GALILEO%7E24%29,GSAT0219%7E%28GALILEO%7E23%29,GSAT0224%7E%28GALILEO%7E28%29,GSAT0225%7E%28GALILEO%7E29%29,GSAT0227%7E%28GALILEO%7E30%29,GSAT0101%7E%28GALILEO-PFM%29,GSAT0102%7E%28GALILEO-FM2%29,GSAT0211%7E%28GALILEO%7E14%29,GSAT0209%7E%28GALILEO%7E12%29,GSAT0208%7E%28GALILEO%7E11%29,GSAT0207%7E%28GALILEO%7E15%29,GSAT0206%7E%28GALILEO%7E10%29) to see, for example, the [Galileo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_(syst%C3%A8me_de_positionnement)) constellation composed of **30** satellites, where each satellite’s coverage helps determine your position at all times.

# Low Earth Orbit (LEO)
Let’s get as close as possible to our surface with Low Earth Orbit, the most populated region, where around **85%** of all satellites reside. These are satellites roughly within **2000km** of Earth.  
This orbit is so popular mainly because it takes minimal resources to place satellites here, making space accessible to smaller players. Additionally, communication delays are almost negligible compared to the **22 seconds** in geostationary orbits.  
Because they are nearby, these satellites orbit Earth very quickly ,  in only about **90 minutes**. That’s why astronauts aboard the **ISS** (which travels at about **28,000km/h**) see **16** sunsets per day 🌅.  
Although a LEO passes over many areas rapidly, its coverage is limited, which necessitates multiple ground stations for continuous contact.
![Couverture ISS](/images/blog/2024/type-orbits/type-orbits5.svg)
In fact, the mega constellation of [Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/) satellites from **SpaceX** is in LEO, now totaling over **6000** satellites (more than half of all satellites), and growing.

# Polar Orbit
A **polar orbit** (a type of low Earth orbit) circles over the poles with an inclination of **90°**. Because Earth rotates, satellites in this orbit can cover the entire globe very quickly.
![Orbite polaire](/images/blog/2024/type-orbits/type-orbits6.svg)
On our diagram, the scale relative to the **Sun** is simplified, but it clearly shows that the advantage is satellites always facing the **Sun** ,  ensuring continuous energy reception ☀️.

# Sun-Synchronous Orbit (SSO)
A **sun-synchronous orbit** is a near-polar orbit that is selected to allow the satellite to observe every part of **Earth** at the same local time. This is particularly useful for climate studies.
![Orbite héliosynchrone SSO](/images/blog/2024/type-orbits/type-orbits7.svg)
This is the orbit used by the **NOAA** satellites from which we retrieved images in <SmartLink slug="noaa">this project</SmartLink>.

# Highly Elliptical Orbit (HEO)
A unique orbit characterized by an elliptical path, meaning the satellite swings from very near to Earth to extremely far away.
![Orbite elliptique élevée HEO](/images/blog/2024/type-orbits/type-orbits8.svg)
This orbit is used, for example, by Russian satellites. On such an orbit, they move slowly during **apogee** to provide prolonged coverage at northern latitudes and rapidly during **perigee** near southern latitudes. This example refers specifically to the [Molniya orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molniya_orbit).  
There’s also the [Tundra orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tundra_orbit), but generally, HEOs are particularly useful for telecommunications in **polar regions**.

And that’s it for the main types of orbits. Today, there are over **10,000** satellites orbiting **Earth**. It isn’t easy to know the exact number, but you can get a good overview at [Orbiting now](https://orbit.ing-now.com/) 🔍.
