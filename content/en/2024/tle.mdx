To predict when a satellite will pass over a specific location, we need to understand how its orbit is described. For that, we use a standard called **TLE**, which is based on **6 physical parameters**.

# TLE (Two-Line Elements)
To figure out when a satellite will fly over us, we can use tools like [SatDump](https://www.satdump.org/download/), [N2YO](https://www.n2yo.com/), or others. All of them rely on **TLE** (**T**wo **L**ine **E**lements), which are unique to each object orbiting **Earth**. [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Aeronautics_and_Space_Administration) and [NORAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Aerospace_Defense_Command) regularly calculate these values (since orbits change) and publish them on databases like [CelesTrak](https://celestrak.org/Norad/elements/table.php?GROUP=weather&FORMAT=tle), which power our prediction tools.  
Let’s take the **TLE** of **NOAA 19** as an example:
```
NOAA 19
1 33591U 09005A   24285.49466946  .00000972  00000-0  54355-3 0  9997
2 33591  99.0340 342.4576 0013141 327.7681  32.2687 14.13153634808053
```

The second line is the one we care about because it’s what determines the object’s orbit. For the curious, these numbers are the foundation of the [Orbital Mechanics](https://orbitalmechanics.info/) website.

# Inclination
Labeled `i`, it’s the angle of inclination (in °) of the **orbital plane** relative to the equatorial plane.  
In **blue**, we have the **Earth’s orbital plane**, in **orange**, the satellite’s plane.

![Orbital Mechanics Inclination](/images/blog/2024/tle/tle6.webp)

There are three types of inclination:
- `0° ≤ i ≤ 90°`: **Prograde**, where the orbit follows the same rotation direction as **Earth** (west to east).
- `90° < i ≤ 180°`: **Retrograde**, where the orbit is reversed (east to west).
- `i = 90°`: **Polar orbit**, covering all latitudes.

# Right Ascension of the Ascending Node
Labeled `Ω`, it’s the angle between the **ascending node** and the **vernal equinox**.  

## Ascending Node
The **ascending node** is the point where the satellite crosses the **Earth’s orbital plane** going "upward." The **descending node** is the opposite.

## Vernal Equinox
The **vernal equinox** is essentially the ascending node of the **Sun’s orbit** relative to **Earth**.

## Right Ascension of the Ascending Node
It’s the angle between the **ascending node** and the **vernal equinox**.

Okay, I’ll admit, this one’s the hardest to grasp, but check out what happens when we tweak this angle using **Orbital Mechanics**:

# Semi-Major Axis
Labeled `a`, it represents half the major axis of an ellipse.

Here’s how the orbit changes when we adjust this value:

# Eccentricity
Labeled `e`, it measures the flattening of the ellipse.  
For `e = 0`, the orbit is circular.  
For `0 < e < 1`, the orbit is elliptical (closed).  
For `e = 1`, the trajectory is parabolic (open).  
For `e > 1`, the trajectory is hyperbolic (open).

Changing `e`:

# Argument of Periapsis
Labeled `ω`, it’s the angle (in °) between the **ascending node** and the **periapsis** (the point in the orbit closest to the central body).
![Argument of Periapsis Diagram](/images/blog/2024/tle/tle10.svg)

The **periapsis** is the point in the orbit where the satellite is closest to the body it’s orbiting. 
If the body is **Earth**, we call it **perigee** and **apogee** (**perihelion** and **aphelion** for the **Sun**).
Let’s see what happens when we change this value:

# True Anomaly
Labeled `𝜈`, it’s the angle (in °) between the periapsis and the satellite’s current position.
![True Anomaly Diagram](/images/blog/2024/tle/tle12.svg)

So, to summarize:
- The **size** and **shape** of the orbit are determined by the **semi-major axis** and **eccentricity**.
- The **orientation** is defined by the **inclination**, **right ascension of the ascending node**, and **argument of periapsis**.
- The satellite’s position is given by the **true anomaly**.

And that’s it, we made it to the end, **CONGRATS** 😎.
Remember, we often use **TLE** because they allow us to predict when a satellite will pass over a specific location.
