In the world of radio waves, traditional systems rely on components like resistors, capacitors, and coils to build circuits that process signals.  
For those of us who just want to **explore** radio without dealing with bulky, expensive components, and the technical know-how to modify them, digital technology comes to the rescue, letting us dive into the realm of radio frequencies for almost nothing 🎉.

# Digital Receiver  
The idea is to digitize the radio signal as early as possible so it can be processed by a **CPU**. This lets you apply more complex algorithms, especially using **complex numbers**, which can be a headache to implement with just analog components.  
Yes, those famous complex numbers you thought were useless in high school turn out to be very useful for digitizing signals.  
- The **real** part represents the signal's <SmartLink slug="am">amplitude</SmartLink> (its "height").  
- The **imaginary** part represents its <SmartLink slug="phase">phase</SmartLink> (its position in time).

This simplifies many mathematical operations.  
Not convinced? Consider multiplying two signals (you don't need to know all the details).  
Without complex numbers, you’d have to perform some pretty twisted **trigonometric** calculations. With complex numbers, you simply multiply the <SmartLink slug="am">amplitudes</SmartLink> and add the <SmartLink slug="phase">phases</SmartLink>, done easily with basic algebra.

Plus, digital systems update in real time, which is great for software and algorithms.  
Another major advantage of digital is the ability to visualize the **frequency spectrum** and produce a **spectrogram** (often called a **waterfall**), which is very useful for understanding what's happening.

It's like using [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) to analyze network packets 🦈.

# Sampling Rate  
Radio signals are **analog** and contain an infinite range of values, something our **CPUs** don’t like. So we sample the signal at regular intervals, converting it into a finite series of numbers.  
Essentially, we measure the signal's amplitude at regular points and record those values. This is called the **sampling rate**!  
This process is enabled by an [Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convertisseur_analogique-num%C3%A9rique).  
The more samples you take, the more accurately the digital signal represents the real one, but the data becomes larger and takes longer to process.

There's also the [Nyquist–Shannon theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%A9or%C3%A8me_d%27%C3%A9chantillonnage) which states that to faithfully reconstruct an analog signal, you must sample at least twice its maximum frequency.

# SDR Receivers  
Digitizing and processing signals via software is known as **SDR** (**S**oftware **D**efined **R**adio).  
This is made possible by receivers like the one shown below:  
![RTL SDR-V4](/images/blog/2024/sdr/sdr2.png)
These affordable receivers (check out [this great starter kit](https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/1005005952566458.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.main.5.73d9dbXPdbXPEG&algo_pvid=525e2d1d-0980-4b25-9e4f-38905fefd577&algo_exp_id=525e2d1d-0980-4b25-9e4f-38905fefd577-2&pdp_npi=4%40dis%21EUR%2148.30%2148.30%21%21%2151.30%2151.30%21%4021059dbe17169245427093658e3802%2112000035000699472%21sea%21FR%214844539949%21&curPageLogUid=JaGxsn71xaP6&utparam-url=scene%3Asearch%7Cquery_from%3A)) connect to a computer via **USB** and run SDR software (there are several options available).  
They usually incorporate an **MCX** (Micro Coaxial eXtended) connector, a smaller coaxial plug, to connect your antenna.  
Note that these receivers only support signal reception; for transmission, devices like the [HackRF](https://www.passion-radio.fr/emetteur-sdr/hackrf-sdr-75.html) are required.

# SDR Software  
Once you have an **SDR** receiver, you just need SDR software. My personal favorite is [SDR++](https://www.sdrpp.org/) for general listening.  
Other notable options include [SatDump](https://www.satdump.org/download/), which is essentially SDR++ but specialized for receiving and decoding **satellite** signals, and [SDRAngel](https://www.sdrangel.org/), which comes with plugins for displaying interactive maps, ideal for applications like <SmartLink slug="adsb">ADS-B</SmartLink> reception.

Also, there’s the DragonOS Linux distribution (<SmartLink slug="dragonos">DragonOS</SmartLink>), which comes pre-installed and configured with all these SDR tools.
