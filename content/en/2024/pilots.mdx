If you check out [FlightRadar](https://www.flightradar24.com), chances are an airplane is flying close to you. You might even be less than a **ten-kilometer** radius from an airport. In these cases, a simple <SmartLink slug="sdr">SDR</SmartLink> receiver paired with an <SmartLink slug="antenna">antenna</SmartLink> can let you tap into all those communications 🥷🏽.

# How Do Pilots Communicate?
## Modulation
Air traffic communications use <SmartLink slug="am">amplitude modulation</SmartLink> even though most radio communications today use [frequency modulation](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulation_de_fr%C3%A9quence#:~:text=En%20modulation%20de%20fr%C3%A9quence%2C%20l,(atténuation%20et%20bruit%20importants).).  
While FM generally delivers better signal quality, it's more complex and requires hardware that’s more power-hungry and heavier—a real concern in aviation 🛩️.  
Plus, **AM** is way more robust than FM, meaning the signal holds up better against obstacles like bad weather, mountains, and large buildings. This lets the transmission reach farther distances.

## Polarization
Air traffic communications use **vertical polarization**. This refers to the direction of the electric field in an electromagnetic wave. [This site](https://culturesciencesphysique.ens-lyon.fr/ressource/simu-polarisation.xml) explains the various types of polarization nicely.  
Simply put, a vertically polarized wave should be picked up by an antenna oriented **vertically**. Otherwise, you risk losing a large portion of the signal.

## Which Frequencies?
Have you ever seen the [frequency allocation spectrum](https://www.anfr.fr) from the ANFR?

It can be hard to tell on a small screen, but zoom in on the region allocated to aeronautical communications within the [VHF](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Très_haute_fréquence) band.

These frequencies fall between `108` and `137MHz`. Now you need to know which frequencies within that range are used near you so you can tune in.

# Getting the Right Information
A great site that shows the frequencies used in aviation—complete with a map—is [Openaip](https://www.openaip.net). You can view the map by clicking [here](https://www.openaip.net/map).  
For example, let’s look at Bordeaux-Mérignac **BOD** airport.

On the side, you can see a bunch of frequencies used by the airport, including the control tower (labeled **TWR**).

# Time to Listen
In my case, I use [SDR++](https://www.sdrpp.org) because I like the software, but any SDR software works similarly.  
- First, plug in your **SDR** receiver connected to your antenna.  
- Set an appropriate gain and choose **AM** as the modulation mode.  
- Also, adjust the **bandwidth** to around `15000` Hz.  
Once that’s done, you can either manually select a frequency you found on [Openaip](https://www.openaip.net) or simply monitor the spectrogram for any visible peaks.

Here’s a snippet of what I managed to pick up:  

Communications aren’t continuous, so be patient. Wait until you see a peak, tune in, and enjoy the listen.  
Also note that you can use a [squelch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squelch) setting to mute background noise and listen only when a transmission occurs.
