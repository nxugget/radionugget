American NOAA satellites that we covered in <SmartLink slug="noaa">my first project</SmartLink> are kind of the starting point for any satellite radio enthusiast. But there are other very similar satellites that deliver better images using roughly the same gear as NOAA, the Russian **METEOR** satellites 🇷🇺.

# Who Are the METEOR?
The **METEOR** satellites started as Soviet, then Russian weather satellites. Since **1964**, about **70** models have been launched. For this article, we’re focusing only on the latest series, **METEOR-M**, and here’s a brief history:

Like their NOAA counterparts, the METEOR-M series orbits at roughly **800km** altitude and follows a **polar** orbit, more precisely, a **sun-synchronous** orbit. That means they always face the **Sun** 🌞. For more information on orbit types, check out <SmartLink slug="orbits">this lesson</SmartLink>.

A sun-synchronous orbit means the satellite passes over the same locations at the same [solar time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temps_solaire) **twice a day**.  
The main difference from NOAA is in the transmission mode: METEOR-M uses [LRPT](https://www.sigidwiki.com/wiki/Low_Rate_Picture_Transmission_(LRPT)), whereas NOAA used [APT](https://www.sigidwiki.com/wiki/Automatic_Picture_Transmission_(APT)).  
For this article, we’re interested in two METEOR-M satellites:

Note that **METEOR M2-4** is still in a testing phase. Its frequency sometimes fluctuates between `137.1` and `137.9MHz`, and its symbol rate varies between **72** and **80Kbit/s**.  
To verify its status, you can use [this site](https://usradioguy.com/meteor-satellite/), which shows the current state of the satellite as of **09/02/2024**.

# Time to Listen
On the antenna side, I use a <SmartLink slug="qfh">QFH</SmartLink> for `137MHz`. It features **left-hand circular polarization**, ideal for METEOR since they transmit with **right-hand circular polarization**.
For reception, we use [SatDump](https://www.satdump.org/download/). I won’t go into all the configuration details (I’ve already done a tutorial on **SatDump** [here](https://www.satdump.org/download/)), but here’s the gist:
- First, using the `Tracking` section in SatDump or via [this website](https://www.n2yo.com/?s=33591), check when the satellite will pass by. This section also shows the satellite's current **elevation**.

- In the `Device` section, select your **SDR** receiver, in my case, an [SDRPlay RSP1B](https://www.passion-radio.fr/recepteurs-sdr/rsp1-b-2669.html), then hit **Start** to begin recording.
- I recommend adjusting the `FFT Min` and `FFT Max` values in the `FFT` section: set `FFT Min` low enough that noise is barely visible, and then set `FFT Max` to `FFT Min + 30`.

- In the `Processing` section, choose **METEOR M2-x LRPT 72k**. Set `Primary` to `137.900MHz` and `Backup` to `137.100MHz`.  
Click **Start** again to begin the decoding process. If everything is set correctly, you should see the signal from **METEOR M2-4** 🛰️!
To ensure the decoding is going smoothly, check that:
  - The SNR (displayed at the bottom) is ideally **10** or above. Even if it’s **>2**, you should still see something.
  - The `Viterbi` section at the bottom-right is all green, indicating good performance. 😄

⚠️ Once the satellite has passed, click **Stop** in the `Processing` section before stopping the recording in the `Device` section. Reversing this order might cause you to lose the recorded data.

After the pass, wait a few moments while **SatDump** finishes decoding everything, then switch over to the `Viewer` tab to see your images and apply post-processing.

You can tweak various settings to get false-color or infrared images:

The image quality is really impressive compared to NOAA’s.
Now it’s your turn, have fun and happy decoding!
